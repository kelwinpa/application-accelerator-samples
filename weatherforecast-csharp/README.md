# C# Sample Accelerator

A sample accelerator for C#.

This sample is the Weather Forecast RESTful API application made available from Microsoft.

The starting source for this sample was created using:
```
$ dotnet new webapi --framework net6.0 --language C#
```

## Running the app locally

To run the sample application:

```
$ dotnet run
```

## Deploying to Kubernetes as a TAP workload with Tanzu CLI

> NOTE: The provided `config/workload.yaml` file uses the Git URL for this sample. When you want to modify the source, you must push the code to your own Git repository and then update the `spec.source.git` information in the `config/workload.yaml` file.

If you make modifications to the source, push these changes to your own Git repository.

When you are done developing your app, you can simply deploy it using:

```
tanzu apps workload apply -f config/workload.yaml
```

If you would like deploy the code from your local working directory you can use the following command:

```
tanzu apps workload create sample-app -f config/workload.yaml \
  --local-path . \
  --source-image <REPOSITORY-PREFIX>/sample-app-source \
  --type web
```

## Accessing the app deployed to your cluster

Determine the URL to use for the accessing the app by running:

```
tanzu apps workload get sample-app
```

To access the deployed app use the URL shown under "Workload Knative Services" and append the endpoint `/weatherforecast` to that URL.

This depends on the TAP installation having DNS configured for the Knative ingress.

## Deploying to Azure Sping Apps with Azure CLI

### Login to Azure

Login to the Azure CLI and choose your active subscription. 

```shell
az login
az account list -o table
az account set --subscription ${SUBSCRIPTION}
```

### Create Azure Spring Apps service instance

Prepare a name for your Azure Spring Apps service.  The name must be between 4 and 32 characters long and can contain only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.  The first character of the service name must be a letter and the last character must be either a letter or a number.

Create a resource group to contain your Azure Spring Apps service.

> Note: This step can be skipped if using an existing resource group

```shell
az group create --name ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
    --location ${REGION}
```

Accept the legal terms and privacy statements for the Enterprise tier.

> Note: This step is necessary only if your subscription has never been used to create an Enterprise tier instance of Azure Spring Apps.

```shell
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.SaaS
az term accept --publisher vmware-inc --product azure-spring-cloud-vmware-tanzu-2 --plan asa-ent-hr-mtr
```

Create an instance of Azure Spring Apps Enterprise.

```shell
az spring create --name ${SPRING_APPS_SERVICE} \
    --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
    --location ${REGION} \
    --sku Enterprise
```

> Note: The service instance will take around 10-15 minutes to deploy.

Set your default resource group name and cluster name using the following commands:

```shell
az configure --defaults \
    group=${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
    location=${REGION} \
    spring=${SPRING_APPS_SERVICE}
```

### Create the application in Azure Spring Apps

Create an application:

```shell
az spring app create --name ${SERVICE_APP} \
  --assign-endpoint true \
  --instance-count 1 \
  --memory 1Gi
```
> Note: The app will take around 2-3 minutes to create.

### Build and Deploy the Application

Deploy and build the application, specifying its required parameters

```shell
az spring app deploy --name ${SERVICE_APP} \
    --source-path weatherforecast-csharp 
```
> Note: Deploying the application will take 5-10 minutes

### Test the Application

Run the following commands

```shell
export APP_URL=$(az spring app show --name ${SERVICE_APP} --query properties.url | tr -d '"')

open "${APP_URL}/WeatherForecast"
```
